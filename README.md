# Bare bear, A WordPress Theme

Bare theme. This theme is intended as a starting point for future projects. It strips out a load of  WordPress crap. I wanted to call it just 'bare' but someone has that theme name already.

## Installation

Clone or download, rename the theme folder and change the theme name in `styles.css` then run `npm install`.

## Prerequisites

Node, Gulp CLI and a virtual machine running WordPress.
