# Bare bear

A bare WordPress theme. This theme is intended as a starting point for future projects. It strips out a load of WordPress crap. I wanted to call it just 'bare' but someone has that theme name already.

## Installation and building assets

Clone or download, rename the theme folder and change the theme name in `styles.css` then run `npm install`.

### Optional

If you going to riff on this theme and make a new one, you might want to consider changing the language and function namespace/scope. Simply do a find a replace for the following string `_bare`.

## Prerequisites

Node, Gulp CLI and a virtual machine running WordPress (for local development).
