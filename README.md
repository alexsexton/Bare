# Bare bear. A WordPress Theme

Bare theme. This theme is intended as a starting point for future projects. It strips out a load of  WordPress crap. I wanted to call it just 'bare' but someone has that theme name already. 

## Installation

Clone and run `npm install`.

## Prerequisites

Node, Gulp CLI and a virtual machine running WordPress.
